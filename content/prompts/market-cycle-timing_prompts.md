- Prompt 1: A hyperrealistic view of Tokyo's skyline at night, vibrant and bustling, with animated charts showing a dramatic spike in property prices. The overall mood is optimistic but with a subtle undercurrent of unease.

- Prompt 2: A time-lapse of Tokyo real estate market from 2012 to 2024, starting with empty streets and gradually building up to crowded sidewalks and construction sites. The color palette transitions from muted tones to vibrant, almost oversaturated colors, representing the rising prices and increased market activity.

- Prompt 3: A dramatic scene depicting a crowded ballroom filled with people celebrating and dancing, symbolizing the peak of the real estate market. As the music crescendos, subtle visual cues like flickering lights and worried expressions start to appear, hinting at an impending crash.

- Prompt 4: A close-up shot of a graph illustrating the "boom and bust" cycle in real estate. The graph should be dynamic, with lines moving to show market fluctuations, accompanied by historical imagery of past economic crises. The style is educational yet engaging.

- Prompt 5: A wide shot of an empty dance floor in the early hours of the morning, illuminated by faint light, symbolizing the aftermath of a financial crisis. In the foreground, a few scattered items like discarded champagne glasses and confetti. A sense of desolation and aftermath, with a subtle hint of opportunity for those who are prepared.
