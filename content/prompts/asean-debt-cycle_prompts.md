- Prompt 1: A dramatic scene depicting the Titanic sinking slowly into a dark, icy ocean. In stark contrast, a small, sturdy boat is sailing confidently through calmer, sunlit waters towards a tropical island. The imagery symbolizes the economic decline of developed nations versus the growth potential of Southeast Asia. High resolution, cinematic lighting.
- Prompt 2: A hyperrealistic visualization of debt charts for Japan, the United States, and ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam). The Japanese and American charts are towering and overflowing with red, indicating massive debt. The ASEAN charts are significantly smaller and mostly green, representing healthier economies. The charts transition to a bustling Southeast Asian city skyline.
- Prompt 3: A split-screen animation showing population pyramids. On the left, Japan's pyramid is inverted, indicating an aging population with a small base. On the right, the Philippines' pyramid is wide at the base and tapers gradually, signifying a young, growing population. The Philippines animation then transitions to scenes of bustling markets and construction sites.
- Prompt 4: A sweeping aerial view of Manila, Philippines, showcasing its vibrant cityscape with modern high-rise buildings alongside traditional homes. Focus on the ongoing construction of subway lines and infrastructure projects. The scene should capture the energy and rapid development of the city. High resolution, sunny day.
- Prompt 5: A dynamic sequence showing money flowing from west to east, from developed countries (e.g., New York, London) to Southeast Asian hubs (e.g., Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta). Emphasize the shift of wealth through animated currency symbols moving across a world map. Include realistic depictions of traders and investors in these locations.
