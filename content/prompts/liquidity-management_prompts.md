- Prompt 1: A grim visual metaphor for eroding cash value: melting ice cubes gradually disappearing to reveal the words "Cash is Trash" written in the melting water. The setting is a cold, desolate landscape. High definition, realistic, cinematic.

- Prompt 2: A powerful image of a hunter, camouflaged and alert, with a rifle loaded and ready to fire. The background is a dense forest with rays of sunlight piercing through the canopy. The hunter represents an investor with dry powder ready to strike at the right opportunity. Focus on realism and detail.

- Prompt 3: A split-screen comparison: On one side, a pile of cash slowly decaying and covered in dust ("dead money"). On the other side, a gleaming strongbox filled with gold bars, symbolizing strategic assets and financial strength ("dry powder"). High contrast, vibrant colors on the strongbox side.

- Prompt 4: A panoramic shot of a financial market crash in progress, with charts plummeting and news headlines flashing in the background. In the foreground, a single investor stands calmly, holding a briefcase full of cash, ready to capitalize on the opportunity. Emphasize the chaos and opportunity.

- Prompt 5: An animated sequence depicting the "5% rule." Start with a pie chart representing total assets. A slice of 5% gradually separates from the rest, transforming into a stack of cash. The background is a dynamic stock market ticker tape. Clean, informative, and visually engaging.
